    "**In data science interviews, A/B testing is rarely just about p-values and confidence intervals.**\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a proxy for something much bigger. Interviewers use A/B testing questions to understand:\n",
    "- **How you think** through problems from start to finish\n",
    "- **How you deal with ambiguity** when there's no single correct answer\n",
    "- **How you turn messy data into decisions** that actually matter to the business\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where many strong candidates struggle—not because they don't know the math (most do), but because they lack a **clear mental model for the full A/B testing lifecycle**. They jump straight to analysis when they should be asking: *What hypothesis are we testing? Why these metrics? What trade-offs are we accepting?*\n",

    "\n",
    "### The Business Context\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cookie Cats** is a popular mobile puzzle game. Like many free-to-play games, it uses \"gates\"—points where players must wait or make an in-app purchase to continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gates serve two purposes:\n",
    "1. **Monetization**: Players can pay to skip the wait\n",
    "2. **Engagement**: Breaks prevent burnout and give players a reason to return\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Interview Insight: How to Frame a Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "In interviews, many candidates state their hypothesis as a simple prediction:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *\"Moving the gate will increase retention.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "Strong candidates frame it with **reasoning** and **risks**:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *\"Moving the gate from level 30 to level 40 might improve early retention because players get more uninterrupted gameplay before hitting the first paywall—reducing frustration during the critical onboarding period. However, there's a risk: players who reach level 40 before any gate may become so invested that the sudden stop feels more jarring, causing them to quit entirely rather than wait or pay.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "The second framing shows you've thought about:\n",
    "- **The mechanism** (why you think it will work)\n",
    "- **The counterfactual** (what could go wrong)\n",
    "- **The trade-off** (early retention vs. long-term engagement)\n",

    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis**: Moving the gate later will improve 1-day retention by reducing early frustration.\n",

    "**Risk**: Players may quit at higher levels when they finally hit the gate.\n",

    "| **Primary** | 1-Day Retention | Most sensitive to onboarding changes; captures immediate impact | May miss long-term effects |\n",
    "| **Secondary** | 7-Day Retention | Captures whether players stick around | Slower to move; more variance |\n",
    "| **Guardrail** | Engagement (rounds/player) | Ensures we're not gaming retention at the cost of depth | Can increase even if quality decreases |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why These Specific Metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    "**1-Day Retention as Primary:**\n",
    "- Moves faster than 7-day (shorter feedback loop)\n",
    "- Most sensitive to early game experience\n",
    "- Strong predictor of long-term value\n",
    "\n",
    "**7-Day Retention as Guardrail (not secondary):**\n",
    "- The gate change could improve day-1 but hurt week-1\n",
    "- We need to ensure we're not just delaying churn\n",

    "**Engagement as Guardrail:**\n",
    "- A player who returns but plays less is a warning sign\n",
    "- Prevents Goodhart's Law (optimizing the metric, not the goal)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Trade-off Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we're optimizing**: Short-term retention (1-day)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we're protecting**: Long-term retention (7-day) and engagement depth\n",
    "\n",
    "**The implicit bet**: We believe improving early retention will have positive downstream effects, but we're setting guardrails to detect if we're wrong.\n",

Bonferroni is more conservative—it controls the probability of any false positive, which is appropriate when false positives are very costly (like medical trials). Benjamini-Hochberg is less conservative—it controls the expected proportion of false positives among discoveries, which is appropriate when you're doing exploratory analysis and can tolerate some false positives in exchange for not missing true effects.

    "1. **Lead with the lifecycle, not the math.** Start by framing the question and choosing metrics before touching any code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Validate before you analyze.** SRM checks aren't optional—they're the first line of defense against bad data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Trade-offs are everywhere.** Articulating what you're optimizing vs. protecting shows business maturity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Negative results are valuable.** An experiment that disproves your hypothesis is still a successful experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Connect to business impact.** Translate statistical results into dollars, users, or concrete outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Know your uncertainty.** Strong candidates acknowledge what they don't know and suggest next steps.\n",
