For example, at Netflix, they use CUPAC because they have billions of user features. CUPED is simpler and works well with just a pre-experiment measure of the outcome. If I have limited features or smaller samples, CUPED is usually sufficient and more interpretable. The key is whether the added complexity of ML provides meaningful variance reduction.\"*\n",
